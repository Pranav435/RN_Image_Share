<h2> Privacy policy </h2>
<p> This app does not collect user information such as log in details, etc. However, this app does use some permissions, that are listed below </p>
<ol><p> Permissions </p>
<li> Camera, to take pictures that can be shared with social media </li>
<li> Storage permission, so that the user can select an image </li>
<li> Sharing permission, so that the user can share the data </li>
<li> Contacts, to show suggested contacts while uploading the image </li>
<li> Microphone, to be able to record video <</li>
</ol>
<p> Furthermore, the app does not use the permissions until they are asked, in the sense that until the user clicks on the appropriate button, the app does not ask for the permission. Thus, some permissions like Camera and audio recording can be completely skipped. </p>
